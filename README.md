This workshop will give a whirlwind tour of React and Redux, demonstrating the core principles and providing a platform to build on.

## Focus of this workshop
We will learn about React and build React components using the well-known Todo application as our use-case. After making a few components and making them render to the screen, we'll install Redux. We'll then move our state over to be handled by Redux and inject it back into React.

Time estimate: 4-6 hours

## What you need
-	Google Chrome
  - Extension: "[React dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)"
  - Extension: "[Redux dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)"
-	An text editor that understands JavaScript and React (Atom, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc). If you're using Atom, you'll need to install the plugin `react` as well.
-	NodeJS (latest) and npm (latest). Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check what version you have. Check the latest version at [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and upgrade if you're out of date.

### Bash (Windows Specifics)
These steps are known to work on Bash (which comes by default on macOS and most Linux Distros), which is likely your default shell.

On Windows, you'll need to take some extra steps.
You can either install:

- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), and use the included "Git BASH" tool, or
- [Ubuntu for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab), which (amongst other things) includes Bash.


## How to get started

* Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
* Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open with the exercise tasks.

## Exercises
This repository contains a set of exercises organized in folders. Each folder contains a `README.md` describing the exercise.

- [Exercise 1](exercise-1/) (start here)
- [Exercise 2](exercise-2/)
- [Exercise 3](exercise-3/)
- [Exercise 4](exercise-4/)
- [Exercise 5](exercise-5/)
- [Exercise 6](exercise-6/)

Remember that you can kill the currently active process on your shell by pressing:

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

### Symbols and notation used in exercises

#### Icons with special meaning

:pencil2: - A task you should do
:book: - A section of text to read (no tasks, just information).
:bulb: - Additional information.
:exclamation: - Something important.
:question: - Open-ended question for the reader ("What do you think would happen if...")
:poop: - Bad practice (don't-do-this)
:star: - A bonus task (not required)

#### Keyboard keys

Will look like this:

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

#### Diff blocks

Emphasizes how lines of text should change.

```diff
- this text was removed
+ and replaced with this text
```

## Standing on the shoulders of giants
These excercises were originally forked from the excellent [React and Redux](https://github.com/nerdschoolbergen/react) workshop materials by [Bergen Nerdschool](https://nerdschoolbergen.github.io/home/).
